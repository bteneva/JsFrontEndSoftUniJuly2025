function printStudent(studentName, studentAge, studentAvgGrade){
   //studentAvgGrade = studentAvgGrade.toFixed(2)
    //console.log(`Name: ${studentName}, Age: ${studentAge}, Grade: ${studentAvgGrade}`)
    console.log(`Name: ${studentName}, Age: ${studentAge}, Grade: ${studentAvgGrade.toFixed(2)}`)
}
