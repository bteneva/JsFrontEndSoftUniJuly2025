// //    8. Perfect Number 
// Write a function that receives a number and checks if that number is perfect or NOT.
// A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
//  That is the sum of its positive divisors excluding the number itself (also known as its aliquot sum).
// Output
//     • If the number is perfect, print: "We have a perfect number!"
//     • Otherwise, print: "It's not so perfect."
